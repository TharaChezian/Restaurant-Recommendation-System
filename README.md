                                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1 MACHINE LEARNING
           Machine learning (ML) is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides the system ability to learn automatically and improve from experience without any explicit  programming [1]. Simply, ML algorithms are Self- learning and Self adaptive AI algorithms. They are applied in almost every field where the data is constantly changing. They learn patterns from the datasets and train themselves without the intervention of humans in the learning process.
Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence, machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a model from sample inputs [2]. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible. The validation and computational investigation of ML method is an area of statistics called as computational learning theory. The process of ML is almost same as data mining and predictive modelling [3]. These two processes recognize patterns in the data and modify the program actions. Numerous researches have been done that to recommend advertisements to the users based on their purchased products in e-shopping. It is due to the recommendation engines which employs ML to customize online ad delivery in real time scenario. Apart from customized marketing, some ML algorithms are used for email filtering, detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach, optical character recognition (OCR), learning to rank, and computer vision [4].

1.1.1 Types of Machine Learning
On the basis of how the algorithm works, ML techniques can be classified to four types as shown in Figure 1.1. They are supervised ML techniques, unsupervised ML techniques, semi-supervised ML techniques and reinforcement ML techniques [5], [6].

Supervised ML techniques utilizes from what it is has gained knowledge from the previous and present data with the help of labels to predict events. This approach initiates from the training process of dataset, ML develop an inferred function to foresee the output values. The system is capable of providing results to an input data with adequate training process. ML algorithm compares the obtained results with the actual and expected results to identify errors to change the model based on results. Supervised learning algorithms try to model relationships and dependencies between the target prediction output and the input features such that we can predict the output values for new data based on those relationships which it learned from the previous data sets. The main types of supervised learning algorithms include

•	Classification algorithms – These algorithms build predictive models from training data which have features and class labels. These predictive models in-turn use the features learnt from training data on new, previously unseen data to predict their class labels. The output classes are discrete. Types of classification algorithms include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and many more.

•	Regression algorithms – These algorithms are used to predict output values based on some input features obtained from the data. To do this, the algorithm builds a model based on features and output values of the training data and this model is used to predict values for new data. The output values in this case are continuous and not discrete. Types of regression algorithms include linear regression, multivariate regression, regression trees, and lasso regression, among many others.
Unsupervised ML  is a type of machine learning where algorithms work on unlabeled data to discover patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without explicit guidance. Unlike supervised learning, it doesn't have access to correct output labels during training. Instead, the algorithm autonomously identifies similarities, differences, and clusters within the data. Common tasks in unsupervised learning include clustering, where similar data points are grouped together, and dimensionality reduction, which reduces the data's complexity while preserving important information. Unsupervised learning is essential for data exploration, anomaly detection, and understanding underlying structures in data where manual labeling may be challenging or unavailable.
                                                    
                           Fig 1.1 Types of Machine Learning Algorithms

•	Clustering algorithms – Clustering algorithms are unsupervised machine learning techniques that group similar data points together based on their characteristics. They aim to find natural patterns and structures within data without predefined labels. Common clustering algorithms include K-Means, which partitions data into K clusters by iteratively updating centroids, Hierarchical Clustering, which creates a tree-like structure of nested clusters, and DBSCAN, which groups data points based on density and identifies outliers.

•	Association rule learning algorithms – Association rule learning algorithms are unsupervised machine learning techniques that identify interesting relationships or patterns within large datasets. They focus on finding associations between items in transactions, such as products frequently bought together in retail transactions. Common algorithms like Apriori and FP-Growth analyze itemsets' frequencies and generate rules, aiding businesses in market basket analysis and recommendation systems.

Semi-supervised ML is a learning paradigm that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data during training. It combines the benefits of supervised learning, which relies on labeled data for accuracy, with unsupervised learning, which leverages abundant unlabeled data for discovering patterns. By initially training on a small labeled dataset and then incorporating information from the larger unlabeled dataset, semi-supervised learning improves generalization and potentially achieves higher performance. This approach is valuable when acquiring labeled data is expensive or impractical, enabling more efficient and effective learning in various real-world applications.

Reinforcement ML is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. It uses trial-and-error learning, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, allowing the agent to optimize its decision-making process over time.
In order to produce intelligent programs (also called agents), reinforcement learning goes through the following steps:
•	Input state is observed by the agent.
•	Decision making function is used to make the agent perform an action.
•	After the action is performed, the agent receives reward or reinforcement from the environment.
•	The state-action pair information about the reward is stored.
Some applications of the reinforcement learning algorithms are computer played board games (Chess, Go), robotic hands, and self-driving cars.
ML involves the investigation of large amount of data. It needs to provide precise results to find the profitable chances or hazardous risks and it is essential to take more time for proper training. The integration of ML with AI leads to efficiently process large amount of data. Though several types of ML techniques are available, supervised ML approaches are the most popular and commonly used technique.
1.2 DATA ANALYTICS
     Data analytics is the process of extracting meaningful insights and patterns from large and complex datasets to inform decision-making and gain a deeper understanding of various phenomena. It involves the application of statistical techniques, data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools to analyze data and identify trends, correlations, and anomalies. Data analytics plays a crucial role in diverse fields, including business, finance, healthcare, marketing, and more. By converting raw data into actionable information, organizations can make data-driven decisions, optimize processes, predict outcomes, and create personalized experiences, leading to improved efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage.

The data analytics process begins with data collection, where relevant data is gathered and stored in databases or data warehouses. However, raw data often contains errors, missing values, and inconsistencies, necessitating data preprocessing. During this stage, data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis to ensure high-quality data suitable for further exploration. The core of data analytics lies in data analysis and modeling. In this stage, analysts apply various statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the data and construct predictive models. Descriptive analytics techniques are used to summarize historical data and gain insights into past events. On the other hand, predictive analytics techniques aim to forecast future trends and outcomes, enabling  proactive decision-making.
As technology continues to advance and the volume of data grows exponentially, data analytics will play an increasingly vital role in extracting valuable information from complex datasets. Artificial intelligence and big data further enhance the capabilities of data analytics, enabling organizations to harness data's potential and gain a deeper understanding of their operations and customer behaviors. In an ever-changing landscape, data analytics will continue to evolve, revolutionizing industries and shaping the way businesses operate in the future.

1.2.1 Types of Data Analytics
Data analytics can be broadly categorized into four main types, each serving different purposes and providing distinct insights:
1. Descriptive Analytics: This type of analytics focuses on summarizing historical data to provide a clear picture of what has happened in the past. Descriptive analytics uses techniques like data aggregation, data visualization, and basic statistical analysis to answer questions about trends, patterns, and performance metrics. It enables businesses to gain a better understanding of past events and make informed decisions based on historical data.
2. Diagnostic Analytics: Diagnostic analytics goes beyond descriptive analytics and aims to understand why certain events occurred in the past. It involves investigating the root causes of trends, anomalies, or specific outcomes. By analysing relationships and dependencies in the data, diagnostic analytics helps businesses identify factors that influenced past outcomes and aids in troubleshooting issues or improving processes.
3. Predictive Analytics: Predictive analytics uses historical data and statistical modeling techniques to forecast future trends, behaviours, or events. It involves building predictive models that can make educated guesses about what is likely to happen in the future. Predictive analytics is widely used in industries like finance, marketing, and healthcare to anticipate customer preferences, forecast sales, or predict potential risks.
4. Prescriptive Analytics: Prescriptive analytics is the most advanced form of data analytics, combining elements of descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics. It not only predicts future outcomes but also provides recommendations or solutions to achieve desired outcomes. Prescriptive analytics uses optimization algorithms and simulation models to suggest the best course of action to maximize desired results or minimize risks.
The four types of data analytics are part of a continuum, with each type building on the previous one to provide a more comprehensive understanding of data and facilitate better decision-making. Businesses and organizations often utilize a combination of these analytics approaches to gain valuable insights and drive improvements in various aspects of their operations.

1.3 RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
A recommendation system is a sophisticated information filtering technology that helps users discover relevant and personalized content or items from a vast array of choices. These systems have become an integral part of various online platforms and services, such as e-commerce websites, streaming services, social media platforms, and content recommendation engines. The main objective of a recommendation system is to analyze user data, preferences, and behaviors to provide accurate and timely recommendations that match individual user interests.
There are several approaches to building recommendation systems, with collaborative filtering and content-based filtering being the two primary techniques. 
1. Collaborative Filtering: Collaborative filtering analyzes user-item interactions to find patterns and similarities between users or items. It recommends items to a user based on the preferences of users with similar tastes. Collaborative filtering can be further categorized into user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering.

2. Content-Based Filtering: Content-based filtering recommends items to users based on the content or attributes of the items. It analyzes the characteristics of items that the user has interacted with in the past and suggests similar items based on those attributes.

Each type of recommendation system has its advantages and limitations, and the choice of the most suitable approach depends on factors such as the available data, the nature of the items being recommended, and the desired level of personalization. Hybrid recommendation systems that combine multiple techniques often provide more robust and effective recommendations by leveraging the complementary strengths of different approaches.

To enhance recommendation accuracy and diversity, hybrid recommendation systems combine both collaborative and content-based filtering techniques. These hybrid systems leverage the strengths of each approach and mitigate their weaknesses to provide more effective and personalized recommendations. Context-aware recommendation systems take into account additional contextual information, such as time, location, and device, to tailor recommendations to the user's current context. This contextual awareness allows for more relevant and timely suggestions that align with the user's immediate needs and preferences.

Matrix factorization and deep learning techniques are also employed in recommendation systems to uncover underlying patterns and latent factors that influence user preferences. Matrix factorization helps in dealing with sparse data and improving recommendation accuracy. Deep learning models, such as neural networks, are used for handling complex data like images, audio, or sequential data. However, recommendation systems face challenges like the cold-start problem (when there is limited user data) and the need to balance serendipitous recommendations with user preferences. 

1.3.1 TD-IDF VECTORIZER
The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer is a numerical representation technique commonly used in natural language processing for text data. It converts a collection of text documents into numerical vectors, enabling machine learning algorithms to process and analyze textual data effectively.

The process begins by tokenizing the text, splitting it into individual words or terms. Next, the TF-IDF vectorizer calculates the Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) for each term in each document.

Term Frequency (TF) measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. It is computed as the number of occurrences of a term divided by the total number of terms in the document.

Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) quantifies the rarity of a term across all documents. It is calculated as the logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents containing the term.

The TF-IDF score for each term in each document is obtained by multiplying its Term Frequency (TF) by its Inverse Document Frequency (IDF). This results in a numerical representation that highlights the importance of each term in the context of the entire corpus.

The TF-IDF vectorizer outputs sparse vectors, as most terms have low frequencies in each document. These vectors can be used as input for various text-related tasks, such as text classification, clustering, and information retrieval.

Overall, the TF-IDF vectorizer is a powerful tool for transforming raw text data into meaningful numerical representations, facilitating the application of machine learning algorithms to text analysis tasks. 

1.3.2 SIMILARITY CALCULATOR
A similarity calculator is a tool or algorithm that measures the similarity between two objects or data points based on their attributes or features. The notion of similarity varies depending on the context and the type of data being compared. Here are some common similarity calculators used in different domains:

1. Cosine Similarity:
   Often used in text analysis and collaborative filtering, cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors. It quantifies the similarity in the orientation of two vectors, regardless of their magnitude.

2. Euclidean Distance:
   Used in clustering and pattern recognition, the Euclidean distance calculates the straight-line distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space. It measures the closeness of data points in terms of their geometric positions.

3. Jaccard Similarity:
   Applied in set comparison, Jaccard similarity calculates the ratio of the size of the intersection of two sets to the size of their union. It is commonly used in measuring the similarity between binary data sets.

4. Pearson Correlation Coefficient:
   Employed in data analysis and recommendation systems, Pearson correlation measures the linear relationship between two variables. It quantifies the degree of correlation between data points.

5. Hamming Distance:
   Used in comparing strings of equal length, Hamming distance calculates the number of positions at which two strings differ. It is commonly used in error detection and correction.

6. Manhattan Distance (City Block Distance):
   Similar to Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance calculates the distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space, but it follows only grid-aligned paths (horizontal and vertical), making it useful in certain geometric and network analysis applications.

The choice of similarity calculator depends on the type of data and the specific application. Implementing an appropriate similarity calculator is crucial for tasks like clustering, classification, information retrieval, and recommendation systems, as it directly affects the quality and accuracy of the results.

1.3.3 COSINE SIMILARITY
Cosine similarity is a popular metric used to quantify the similarity between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It is widely employed in various fields, such as information retrieval, text analysis, and recommendation systems.

The similarity is calculated by measuring the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, rather than the magnitude or length of the vectors. This makes it particularly useful for comparing documents or data points represented as high-dimensional vectors, where the magnitude may not be as informative as the direction.

In the context of text analysis, each vector represents a document, and the elements of the vectors correspond to the frequency of words in the document. Cosine similarity is then used to measure how similar the word frequencies are between two documents, effectively determining the semantic similarity.

The range of cosine similarity lies between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates completely dissimilar vectors, 0 indicates orthogonality (no similarity), and 1 indicates perfectly similar vectors with the same direction.

Cosine similarity is efficient to compute and suitable for large datasets, making it a popular choice for many applications. In information retrieval, it aids in finding relevant documents based on user queries. In recommendation systems, it assists in identifying items similar to the ones a user has interacted with.

1.4 RESTAURANT RECOMMANDATION SYSTEM
A restaurant recommendation system is a specialized application of recommendation technology that assists users in discovering suitable dining options based on their preferences, location, and past dining experiences. This system leverages various data sources, including user reviews, ratings, and restaurant attributes, to provide personalized and relevant restaurant suggestions. The recommendation process begins with data collection, where information about restaurants, such as their menus, cuisines, location, operating hours, and user reviews, is aggregated and stored in a database. Additionally, user data, including past restaurant visits, ratings, and reviews, is collected to understand individual preferences and behaviours.
Collaborative filtering is commonly used in restaurant recommendation systems. It analyses user-item interactions and identifies users with similar dining preferences. Based on this analysis, the system recommends restaurants that are favoured by users with similar tastes. For example, if User A and User B have both enjoyed and rated similar restaurants positively, the system might recommend a new restaurant to User A that User B has previously visited and rated highly.

Content-based filtering is another approach used in restaurant recommendation systems. It considers the attributes and characteristics of restaurants, such as cuisine type, price range, ambiance, and location, to suggest restaurants that align with a user's preferences. If a user frequently dines at Italian restaurants, the system will recommend more Italian restaurants that match their culinary preferences. To enhance recommendation accuracy, hybrid recommendation systems combine both collaborative and content-based filtering techniques. This integration helps overcome the limitations of individual approaches and provides more diverse and accurate restaurant suggestions.

Location-based recommendation is also important for restaurant recommendation systems. By leveraging user location data, the system can offer nearby dining options, ensuring convenience and relevance in the recommendations. Context-aware recommendation further refines suggestions by considering factors such as the time of day or day of the week to tailor recommendations to a user's current situation. Furthermore, sentiment analysis of user reviews allows the system to identify positive or negative sentiments related to specific restaurants. This analysis helps ensure that recommended restaurants have a positive reputation and good customer feedback. User feedback is crucial for continuously improving the recommendation system. By collecting and analyzing user feedback on recommended restaurants, the system can adapt and refine its suggestions over time, providing more personalized and satisfying dining experiences for users.
Overall, a well-designed restaurant recommendation system enhances the dining experience for users by presenting them with relevant and appealing restaurant choices. It not only saves users time and effort in selecting restaurants but also supports local businesses by directing customers to establishments that align with their preferences. As technology advances and data availability grows, restaurant recommendation systems will continue to evolve, leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to offer even more accurate, diverse, and context-aware recommendations to users.

1.5 CONTRIBUTION
A restaurant recommendation system makes significant contributions to both users and restaurant owners. For users, it offers a personalized dining experience by suggesting restaurants based on their preferences, past dining history, and location. This not only saves users time and effort in searching for suitable dining options but also enhances their overall satisfaction with relevant and appealing choices. Moreover, the system fosters customer loyalty by continuously updating recommendations, keeping users engaged and returning for repeat business. For restaurant owners, the recommendation system brings increased footfall and revenue generation by directing potential customers to their establishments. Positive user reviews and recommendations contribute to a restaurant's reputation, attracting new customers and supporting business growth. 
The system's data-driven insights enable owners to understand customer preferences, make informed decisions, and optimize their offerings for enhanced customer retention and engagement. Additionally, the recommendation system helps support local businesses by highlighting lesser-known establishments and providing them with increased visibility. Overall, the restaurant recommendation system creates a symbiotic relationship between users and restaurant owners, delivering a personalized dining experience while driving business success and growth.

4.1 OVERVIEW
A restaurant recommendation system is a software or algorithm that suggests dining options to users based on their preferences. It collects data on restaurants, user behaviours, and reviews to create personalized profiles. Two common approaches are collaborative filtering, which recommends based on similar user preferences, and content-based filtering, which matches restaurant attributes to user profiles. Hybrid methods combining both approaches are often used. Machine learning algorithms process and analyse the data, continually improving recommendations. Real-time updates adapt to changes in user behaviour and restaurant information. Location-based suggestions use geolocation data for nearby options. Privacy measures and trust-building features are essential for user confidence. Overall, restaurant recommendation systems enhance the user experience by simplifying the process of finding dining options that match individual tastes and promoting diverse and serendipitous discoveries.

Step 3: Multiply TF matrix with IDF respectively


 








4.5 STEPS FOR COSINE SIMILARITIES
The cosine similarity is a straightforward calculation involving the dot product of two vectors and their magnitudes. Here are the steps to compute the cosine similarity between two vectors:

Step 1: Input
   Obtain two vectors, A and B, that represent the data points or documents you want to compare. These vectors can be represented as lists, arrays, or any other suitable data structure.

Step 2: Compute the Dot Product
    Calculate the dot product of the two vectors (A and B). The dot product is the sum of the element-wise product of the corresponding elements in both vectors.

Step 3: Compute the Magnitude of Vectors
   Calculate the magnitude (or Euclidean norm) of each vector (A and B). The magnitude of a vector is the square root of the sum of the squares of its elements.

Step 4: Calculate the Cosine Similarity
   Divide the dot product of the vectors (from Step 2) by the product of their magnitudes (from Step 3). The resulting value is the cosine similarity.

Step 5: Interpret the Cosine Similarity
    The cosine similarity value will be in the range of -1 to 1. A value close to 1 indicates high similarity, 0 indicates no similarity (orthogonal), and -1 indicates high dissimilarity between the two vectors.

The formula for calculating cosine similarity is as follows:

Cosine Similarity = (A · B) / (||A|| * ||B||)

Where:
- A · B represents the dot product of vectors A and B.
- ||A|| and ||B|| represent the magnitudes (or Euclidean norms) of vectors A and B, respectively.

By following these steps, we can compute the cosine similarity to measure the similarity between two vectors effectively. The cosine similarity is widely used in information retrieval, recommendation systems, text analysis, and various other applications involving vector comparison.

SYSTEM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
5.1 SYSTEM DESIGN
             The figure 5.1. represents the architecture of the system. Gather restaurant data from various sources, such as online review platforms, restaurant websites, or user-generated data. The data should include information like restaurant names, cuisines, locations, ratings, and reviews. Create a user-item interaction matrix based on the collected data. Rows correspond to users, columns correspond to restaurants, and the matrix elements represent user ratings or interactions with restaurants. Choose a collaborative filtering algorithm, such as TD-IDF Vectorizer  and  Cosine similarity The algorithm will analyse the user-item interaction matrix to generate restaurant recommendations. For user-based collaborative filtering, calculate the similarity between users based on their interaction patterns with restaurants. For item-based collaborative filtering, calculate the similarity between restaurants based on user ratings. TF-IDF vectorizer calculates the Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) for each term in each document. Term Frequency (TF) measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. It is computed as the number of occurrences of a term divided by the total number of terms in the document. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) quantifies the rarity of a term across all documents. It is calculated as the logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents containing the term. Calculate the Cosine Similarity Divide the dot product of the vectors by the product of their magnitudes The resulting value is the cosine similarity.

Module 2: Text preprocessing
Text preprocessing is the initial step of cleaning and transforming raw text data to prepare it for further analysis.
	Lower casing
	Removal of Punctuations
	Removal of Stopwords
	Removal of URLs
	Spelling correction
   Stopwords: 
Stopwords are common words (e.g., "the," "and," "is") removed from text data during preprocessing to reduce noise and improve analysis.

Module 3: Td-idf vectorizer
TF-IDF vectorizer transforms text data into numerical vectors, highlighting important words based on term frequency and document frequency.


    

                              Fig 5.1 Architecture of proposed model

The user selects their favourite restaurant using the restaurant recommendation UI, after which the query is entered into collaborative filtering techniques like TD-IDF vectorizer, which converts raw text data into useful numerical representations, making it easier to apply machine learning algorithms to text analysis tasks, and similarity calculator, which measures how similar two vectors are in a multi-dimensional space. Based on the feedback given to the restaurants, customers make customised restaurant selections. This method will propose nearby restaurants that are comparable to the one you previously selected in terms of their cuisines and ratings. This primarily applies when you want to try a different restaurant that has comparable cuisine or ratings to the ones you often prefer.

6.2 RESULT ANALYSIS
Result analysis for a restaurant recommendation system involves evaluating the performance and effectiveness of the system in providing relevant and satisfactory recommendations to users. Several metrics and techniques can be used to analyse the results of the recommendation system:

1. Precision and Recall: These metrics are commonly used to evaluate recommendation systems. Precision measures the proportion of recommended restaurants that the user found relevant,while recall measures the proportion of relevant restaurants that were successfully recommended.

2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): These metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy of predicted ratings. They measure the average difference between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings provided by users.

3. User Satisfaction Surveys: Collecting feedback from users through surveys or interviews can provide valuable insights into their satisfaction with the recommended restaurants. This qualitative feedback can be used to improve the recommendation system.

4. A/B Testing: Conducting A/B testing with different recommendation algorithms or strategies can help compare their performance in terms of user engagement, click-through rates, and other relevant metrics.

5. Diversity of Recommendations: Analyzing the diversity of recommended restaurants can ensure that the system is not only suggesting popular options but also providing diverse choices to cater to different user preferences.

6. Cold Start Problem: Evaluate how well the recommendation system performs for new users with limited interaction history. A good system should be able to provide meaningful recommendations even for users with few interactions.

7. Performance Over Time: Monitor the performance of the recommendation system over time and check if there are any trends or changes in user preferences that need to be considered for continuous improvement.

8. Business Impact: Assess the business impact of the recommendation system by measuring factors like increased user engagement, retention, and revenue generated through restaurant visits influenced by recommendations.
